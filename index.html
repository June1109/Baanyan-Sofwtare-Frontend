<p class="para2"> The Mercedes-Benz C-Class is a series of compact executive cars produced by Mercedes-Benz Group AG.
    Introduced in 1993 as a replacement for the 190 (W201) range, the C-Class was the smallest model in the marque's line-up until the W168 A-Class arrived in 1997.
    The C-Class has been available with a "4MATIC" four-wheel drive option since 2002. The third generation (W204) was launched in 2007 while the current W206 generation was launched in 2021.

<p class="para3"> Initially available in sedan and a station wagon configurations, a fastback coupé (SportCoupé) variant followed and was later renamed to Mercedes-Benz CLC-Class.
    It remained in production until 2011 when a new W204 C-Class coupé replaced it for the 2012 model year.

<p class="para4"> The W205 C-Class was launched at the 2014 North American International Auto Show. The new structure was significantly lighter using aluminium and high strength steel extensively throughout the body,
    resulting in a 100-kilogram (220 lb) weight decrease.[10] The Mercedes-Benz C-Class 205 chassis spawned four C-Class bodystyles; sedan (W205), wagon (S205), coupe (C205), and cabriolet (A205).
